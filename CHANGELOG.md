# What Types of Changes Should be Noted here and How to Note Them?

In order to make all changelogs easier to use and read the following changes should be noted in the same manner and grouped together. This will hopefully create a standard that all can use and benefit from in the future. They are, in alphabetical order;

- Added – For any new features that have been added since the last version was released

- Changed – To note any changes to the software’s existing functionality

- Deprecated – To note any features that were once stable but are no longer and have thus been removed
Fixed– Any bugs or errors that have been fixed should be so noted

- Removed – This notes any features that have been deleted and removed from the software

- Security – This acts as an invitation to users who want to upgrade and avoid any software vulnerabilities
